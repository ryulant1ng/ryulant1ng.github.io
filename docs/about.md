## About This Site

This site use [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) to build, with math equations ($\TeX$) and footnote support.

The main font on this site is [Firava](https://github.com/hellogreg/firava), a variable font fork of [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira). Its design aesthetic evokes a nostalgic sense of my childhood, recalling the era of web pages that featured Trebuchet MS.
